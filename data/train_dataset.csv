In short - you are a skilled leader capable of getting great things done for your customers. If it sounds like you - then read on!As one of the largest companies in the cloud computing space across the world, Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers dozens of services and processes billions of usage records. Over the past 10 years, Amazon has become known across the globe as the most trusted company on the internet.The systems we build interpret and process a very high volume stream of events; often bundled with low-latency/real-time analysis to enable security and fraud detection.AWS Bill Generation team manages the computation engine responsible for generating charges to the customers. Every time any AWS service meters a usage by a customer, a record makes its way to the our computation engine. At the simplest level, the bill computation engine generates bill line items corresponding to usage. Every day the bill computation engine processes hundreds of millions of records. The computation engine is architected to enable us to scale to this computational load and grow with the rapidly growing AWS business.There are numerous highly varied scenarios that the bill computation engine handles: the common most one is that of tiering, i.e. charging customers at different rates based on usage. These tiers may be computed across multiple dimensions: across geographical regions, across accounts, or across services. One of the key goals of the bill computation engine is to build a highly scalable, general purpose multi-dimensional counter mechanism that enables us to support a very flexible set of pricing models. Another key goal is to make the bill computation engine declarative. We want to make it super easy for sellers of cloud services to create complex pricing plans with minimal or no code changes whatsoever.Key Responsibilities:· Adopt overall AWS plans for AWS Commerce Platform and define your own teams future direction.· · Manage projects that deliver on commitments to our customers.· · Manage day-to-day activities of engineering team using Agile/Scrum methodology.· · Manage teams resources: hire, mentor, and grow the engineering team.· · Work closely with engineers to architect and develop the best technical solutions.

We do this by building automated solutions to handle things that technology does well, while relying on people to handle things that humans do well.Our item identification system, SkuMaster, is responsible for the identity of every product in every Amazon Fulfillment Center (FC) worldwide. Identity is the answer to the question, “What is this?” At every point in the supply chain, people and automated systems must be able to uniquely and immediately identify products used to fulfill orders. When products come into the FC, SkuMaster uses the barcode to match the physical item to line items on a Purchase Order. Throughout the fulfillment process, SkuMaster tracks, identifies, and describes the product to the people and automated services to ensure that every customer gets what they ordered on time. Providing a scalable system to support Amazon’s expanding business is a complex architectural challenge, and accurate item identification is a critical piece.

Software Development Engineer,"US, WA, Seattle ","January 22, 2018","We are seeking a Software Development Engineer to lead the team that will help develop Alexa as the most personal, all-knowing shopping assistant in the world.Personalization is a key component of the voice shopping flywheel, and a critical experience to nail for our customers. In this capacity, you will work closely with Alexa teams to build delightful experiences and with Amazon Retail teams to harmonize the how we personalize across both shopping mediums. In this role, you will have the freedom (and encouragement) to experiment, improve, invent, and innovate on behalf of our customers. You will have the satisfaction of being able to look back and say you were a key contributor to something special from its earliest stages. You will lead a team of talented and experienced engineers to define and deliver the natural language shopping experiences for Echo, Fire TV and other Amazon products.Strategy:Our vision is to make Alexa the most personal voice shopping assistant ever by delighting customers with unique “Alexa gets me” shopping experiences. We will achieve this by building and constantly updating rich customer profile based on Amazon wide customer signals. This customer profile will help in modeling their explicit and implicit preferences which can then be used to serve up personalized offers at various steps of their engagement with Alexa like when they are looking to discover deals, searching for specific products for themselves or gifts for others or building their shopping carts across different Amazon programs. Initially, we will start by offering personalized recommendations when customers explicitly engage with Alexa. Over time, as customers build trust with us, we will proactively reach out to them with unique, personalized shopping offers based on what we know about their needs and preferences.Alexa must understand the customer and their preferences comprehensively. When asked, “What are my deals?” Alexa will sort through an expanded selection — thousands of deals available on Amazon.com daily — to offer personalized deal recommendations based on that customer’s behaviors: what they have been searching for, what they have added to their shopping list, or items previously purchased with a high propensity for reorder. Beyond deals, personalization will improve general shopping queries as well. Does the customer often add “organic” to their Amazon.com searches? Alexa will prioritize organic offers in response to requests for groceries. When a customer asks for diapers, the right recommender can identify diaper size based on prior buying patterns and projected age of the child. A recommender for minimum order value will suggest a complement to a past purchase (e.g., the right battery, the right refill). To achieve this, we will integrate with all available .com sources of profile and preference, investing in a customer profile ingestion for voice we can join in order to continuously learn customer patterns across Amazon data stores. We will ingest signals such as past purchases, navigational refinements, web, and voice queries to create a rich model of customer preferences. Reusing technology wherever possible, we will enable a Personal Ranking Engine that flows aggregate customer profile data into a set of recommender strategies, leveraging MAB for continuous improvement.If this sounds intriguing, then we’d like to talk to you about this role.","· Bachelor’s (or above) Degree in Computer Science or related field· 3+ years professional experience in software development· Proficiency in, at least, one modern programming language such as C, C++, Objective C, or Java· Expertise in object-oriented design, data structures, algorithms, and complexity analysis.

Our goal is to provide a framework allowing us to define and measure the quality of these experiences and accelerate language adoption across marketplaces. We believe that, by establishing a platform team and providing tools and mechanisms, we can broadly influence change across Amazon while auditing the quality of our customer experiences.About you:Youre looking for a career where youll be able to build, to deliver, and to impress. You look at problems holistically, and thrive on the intricate complexity of designing feedback loops and ecosystems. You want to work on projects where you are implementing solutions to real problems that require creative solutions and deep understanding of the problem space. You challenge yourself and others to constantly come up with better solutions. This highly visible role requires frequent communication with senior leadership in order to help shape and deliver on the product roadmap, and requires you to nimbly switch between strategic and tactical initiatives to achieve technical, business, and customer experience goals. Youll be given the unique opportunity to own and drive initiatives across the Amazon Retail as a whole -- from algorithmic innovation, all the way down to the datasets that the back-end services consume.About us together:Were going to change the way that Amazon thinks about supporting our global customer. Along the way, were going to face seemingly impossible problems. Were going to argue about how to solve them, and well work together to find a solution that is superior to each of the proposals we came in with. Well make tough decisions, but well all understand why.

You also have a pragmatic approach and iterative approach to building software: you have an ability to simplify and get things done with a demonstrated track record of building and delivering software and working effectively with external and internal teams.Some problem spaces well be working on:DATAMART - as we release new languages across marketplaces, our business teams will want to understand customer trends and interactions with these new marketplaces. Ideally, we want to enable our business teams to report on the various languages within a marketplace as if those languages were individual businesses. As such, we need to create a DataMart that enables all business metrics to be split by language and also enables business users to execute ad hoc queries to answer questions that we have not currently considered. As we create the DataMart, we will have to consider the scale of data that we will be handling (at the scale of Amazons global retail business) and employ BigData techniques to aggregate and manipulate this data. We will need to design the platform to be robust and to seamlessly recover from disaster, should the need arise. Consistency and validation will be primary concerns as we understand that systems fail, specifically systems upon which we rely for signal and we need to protect our business teams from making decisions based upon incomplete information.CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE - as arbiters of the customer experience, we need to understand our customers experience in their languages of preference. Similarly, given the scope of this initiative, it is clear that we will not be able to translate all content in a single release. As a result, it is critical that we can truly measure the customer experience as a function of our translations (both coverage and quality) throughout their journey within the Amazon marketplace. This is further complicated by the fact that our customers receive a unique experience based upon their browse history, so our method of measurement must be considerate of and support such a dynamic experience. Furthermore, in real time and with zero latency, we want to understand when the experience is broken so that we can take appropriate actions. This is going to be a challenge that may make use of the latest BigData streaming technologies to provide a real-time data and measurement pipeline.Questions?:You may already know if youre a fit, but perhaps youre worried about technology and experience requirements?
